# A.I. Final Project

Warehouse simulation which contains multiple agents that find the optimal path to a pickup location, drop off location and resting/starting location. 

The purpose is to maximize efficiency so that the company which potentially handles a warehouse which contains specific parts that they ship can get items from their shelves and have them be dropped off at a location in the warehouse which can then be loaded into a truck for transport.
